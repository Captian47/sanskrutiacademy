    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <b><br /></b> Bholi at first agreed to an unequal match because she was lucky to get a well-to-do bridegroom who owned a big shop, had a house of his own and had several thousand in the bank. Moreover, he was not asking for any dowry. Bholi also heard her mother saying that he did not know about her pock-marks and her lack of sense. If the proposal was not accept she might remain unmarried all her life. She later rejected the marriage because the bride groom demanded five thousand rupees as dowry. On seeing the father pleading and humiliated she decided not to marry him.<br />

    <span style="color: red;">4.&nbsp;Bholi&#8217;s real name is Sulekha. We are told this right at the beginning. But only in the last but one paragraph of the story is Bholi called Sulekha again. Why do you think she is called Sulekha at that point in the story?</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <b><br /></b> The world Bholi means a simpleton. Throughout the story she had been a simpleton hardly expressing her opinion. The word Sulekha means the person with beautiful sense of letters. In this story this word has a larger meaning of being a literate, intelligent and mature individual. After her education Bholi has really changed to Sulekha and her assertion during marriage is her announcement to the world that she is no more a Bholi but Sulekha.</div>
