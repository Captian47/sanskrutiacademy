<span style="color: red;">3. At the beginning of his speech, Mandela mentions &#8220;an extraordinary human disaster&#8221;. What does he mean by this? What is the &#8220;glorious &#8230; human achievement&#8221; he speaks of at the end?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<b>Answer </b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
By human disaster Mandela means to say that coloured people have suffered a lot due to discrimination in the hands of whites. He considered it as great glorious human achievement that a black person became the president of a country where the blacks are not considered as human being and are treated badly.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">

<div style="text-align: left;">
<span style="color: red;">4. What does Mandela thank the international leaders for?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<b>Answer </b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Mandela felt privileged to be the host to the nations of the world because not too long ago, the South Africans were considered outlaws. He thus thanked all the international leaders for having come to witness his investiture as President since this event could be considered as a common victory for justice, peace and human dignity.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">

<div style="text-align: left;">
<span style="color: red;">5. What ideals does he set out for the future of South Africa?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<b>Answer&nbsp;</b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Mandela set out the ideals of poverty alleviation, removal of suffering of people. He also set the ideal for a society where there would be no discrimination based on gender or racial origins.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<span style="color: magenta;"><b><span style="color: black;"> </span></b></span></div>
The highest military generals of the South African defence force and police saluted Mandela and pledged their loyalty.<br />
Their attitude towards blacks had taken great change. Instead of arresting a black they saluted him.<br />

<span style="color: red;">2. Why were two national anthems sung?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<b>Answer </b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
On the day of the inauguration, two national anthems were sung, one by the whites, and the other by the blacks. This symbolized the equality of blacks and whites.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<span style="color: red;">3. How does Mandela describe the systems of government in his country (i) in the first decade, and (ii) in the final decade, of the twentieth century?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
<b> </b> (i) In the first decade of the twentieth century, the white-skinned people of South Africa patched up their differences and erected a system of racial domination against the dark-skinned people of their own land, thus creating the basis of one of the harshest and most inhumane societies the world had ever known.<br />
(ii) In the last decade of the twentieth century, the previous system had been overturned forever and replaced by one that recognized the rights and freedoms of all peoples, regardless of the colour of their skin.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">4. What does courage mean to Mandela?</span><br />
<br />
<b> </b>

<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<b><br /></b>

<br />
For Mandela courage does not mean the absence of fear but a victory over fear. According to him brave men need not be fearless but should be able to conquer fear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">5. Which does he think is natural, to love or to hate?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer </b><br />
<br />
For Mandela, love comes more naturally to the human heart than hate.<br />

<span style="color: red;">1. What &#8220;twin obligations&#8221; does Mandela mention?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer </b><br />
<br />
Mandela mentions that every man has twin obligations. The first is to his family, parents, wife and children; the second obligation is to his people, his community and his country.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">2. What did being free mean to Mandela as a boy, and as a student? How does he contrast these &#8220;transitory freedoms&#8221; with &#8220;the basic and honourable freedoms&#8221;?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
Like any other kid for Mandela also the freedom meant a freedom to make merry and enjoy the blissful life. Once anybody becomes an adult then antics of childhood looks like transitory because most of the childish activity is wasteful from an adult&#8217;s perspective. Once you are adult then someday you have to earn a livelihood to bring the bacon home, then only you get an honourable existence in the family and in the society.<br />
<b></b><br />
<span style="color: red;"> 3. Does Mandela think the oppressor is free? Why/Why not?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
<b> </b> Mandela does not feel that the oppressor is free because according to him an oppressor is a prisoner of hatred, who is locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrow-mindedness. He feels that both the oppressor and the oppressed are robbed of their humanity.<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red;">1. Why did such a large number of international leaders attend the inauguration? What did it signify the triumph of?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
The presence of large number of international leaders was a gesture of solidarity from international community to the idea of the end of apartheid. It &nbsp;signified the triumph of good over evil, the triumph of the idea of a tolerant society &nbsp;without any discrimination.<br />
<br />
<b> </b><br />
<span style="color: red;">2. What does Mandela mean when he says he is &#8220;simply the sum of all those African patriots&#8221; who had gone before him?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
Mandela wants<b> </b>to pay his tribute to all the people who had sacrificed their lives for the sake of freedom. he feels that he is the sum of all those African patriots who had gone before him because those heroes of yesterday years had paved the path of co-operation and unity for him. Therefore, he got the support of his people to be able to come to power to bring equality for his own people.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">3.Would you agree that the &#8220;depths of oppression&#8221; create &#8220;heights of character? How does Mandela illustrate this? Can you add your own examples to this argument?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
Yes, I agree that the &#8220;depths of oppression&#8221; create &#8220;heights of character&#8221;.&nbsp;Nelson Mandela illustrates this by giving examples of great heroes of South Africa who sacrificed their lives in the long freedom struggle. India is full of such examples. During our freedom struggle there was a galaxy of leaders of great characters. Probably the oppression of British rule created so many men of such characters. If we compare this with the quality of political leaders India is having today, then Nelson Mandela seems to be absolutely right.<br />
<span style="color: red;"><br /></span> <span style="color: red;">4. How did Mandela&#8217;s understanding of freedom change with age and experience?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer </b><br />
<br />
With age Nelson Mandela realised that he had a lot of responsibilities of his people, his community and his country. As a boy, Mandela did not have a hunger for freedom because he thought that he was born free. He believed that as long as he obeyed his father and abided by the customs of his tribe, he was free in every possible manner. He had certain needs as a teenager and certain needs as a young man. Gradually, he realized that he was selfish during his boyhood. He slowly understands that it is not just his freedom that is being curtailed, but the freedom of all blacks. It is after attaining this understanding that he develops a hunger for the freedom of his people.<br />
<span style="color: red;"><br /></span> <span style="color: red;">5. How did Mandela&#8217;s &#8216;hunger for freedom&#8217; change his life?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: white; color: black; font-family: inherit; line-height: 22px;"> </span> Mandela realized in his youth that it was not just his freedom that was being curtailed, but the freedom of all blacks. The hunger for his own freedom became the hunger for the freedom of his people. This desire of a non-racial society transformed him into a virtuous and self-sacrificing man. Thus, he joined the African National Congress and this changed him from a frightened young man into a bold man.<br />
