    <div style="text-align: left;">
    The girls wrote a friendly letter to Wanda telling her that she had won the contest. They also wrote how pretty her drawings were. They asked her if she liked the place where she was living and if she liked her new teacher. They wanted to say that they were sorry. However, they ended up with just writing a friendly letter. They signed it with lots of X&#8217;s for love.</div>

    <span style="color: red;">2.&nbsp;Did they get a reply? Who was more anxious for a reply, Peggy or Maddie? How do you know?</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer </b><br />
    <br />
    No, they did not get a reply. Maddie was more anxious for a reply as she thought a lot about it. She would put herself to sleep making speeches about Wanda and defending her from great crowds of girls who were trying to tease her. Before Wanda could press her lips together in a tight line, which she did before answering, Maddie would cry out and ask everybody to stop and then, everybody would feel ashamed the way she felt. Peggy, on the other hand, had begun to forget about the whole affair. This shows that Maddie was more anxious for a reply than Peggy.<br />
    <br />
    <span style="color: red;">3. How did the girls know that Wanda liked them even though they had teased her?</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer&nbsp;</b><br />
    <br />
    The girls came to know that Wanda liked them even though they had teased her as she had asked Miss Mason to give the green dress with red trimming to Peggy and the blue one to Maddie. Later when Maddie looked at the drawing very carefully, she realized that the dress had a face and a head, which looked like her own self. The head and face in the drawing given to Peggy looked just like Peggy. That is why the girls knew that Wanda liked them even though they had teased her.<br />
    <br />
    <b><span style="color: #274e13;">Thinking about the Text&nbsp;</span></b><br />
    <br />
    <span style="color: red;">1. Why do you think Wanda&#8217;s family moved to a different city? Do you think life there was going to be different for their family?</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <br />
    Wanda family moved to different city because of her father felt bad about the bad behaviour of girls towards Wanda.<br />
    <b> </b><br />
    <br />
    <span style="color: red;">2. Maddie thought her silence was as bad as Peggy&#8217;s teasing. Was she right?</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer&nbsp;</b><br />
    <br />
    Yes, Maddie was right when she thought that her silence was as bad as Peggy&#8217;s teasing because her silence encouraged Peggy to tease her. A person who sees something wrong happening in front of him/her is as much an offender as the person committing the offence. Maddie was too afraid to say anything because she did not want to lose Peggy&#8217;s friendship. Also, she was poor herself, so she feared that everybody would make fun of her too.<br />
    <br />
    <span style="color: red;">3. Peggy says, &#8220;I never thought she had the sense to know we were making fun of her anyway. I thought she was too dumb. And gee, look how she can draw!&#8221; What led Peggy to believe that Wanda was dumb? Did she change her opinion later?</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer </b><br />
    <br />
    Peggy believed that Wanda was dumb as she could not understand why Wanda said she had a hundred dresses, even when everybody knew that she was poor. She knew everybody was laughing at her. Even then, she kept giving the same answer. She even described the dresses she said she had. That is why Peggy thought Wanda was dumb. She changed her opinion later when she saw the hundred dresses Wanda had talked about. She saw the drawings and was highly impressed by their beauty. She realized that Wanda was a very good artist.<br />

    <span style="color: red;">4. What important decision did Maddie make? Why did she have to think hard to do so?</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer </b><br />
    <br />
    The important decision that Maddie made was that she would never stand by and say nothing again. If she ever heard anybody picking on someone because they were funny-looking or because they had strange names, she would speak up. She did not even mind losing Peggy&#8217;s friendship over it. She knew she could not make things right with Wanda. However, she had decided that in the future, she would never make anybody else unhappy again.<br />
    She was unhappy that she could not find Wanda at her home. She could not sleep that night. She thought about Wanda, her faded blue dress, and the little house she lived in. She also thought about the hundred glowing pictures, which were all lined up in the classroom. She was feeling guilty of not having said anything when everybody else was teasing Wanda. It was her guilt that made her think very hard and arrive at the important decision.<br />
    <br />
    <span style="color: red;">5. Why do you think Wanda gave Maddie and Peggy the drawings of the dresses? Why are they surprised?</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer&nbsp;</b><br />
    <br />
    Wanda gave Maddie and Peggy the drawings of dresses because they made fun of her hundred dresses. They believe her to be a liar. They were surprised because they always made fun of here dresses and insulted her, but she had gifted them with those beautiful designs.<br />
    <br />
    <span style="color: red;">6. Do you think Wanda really thought the girls were teasing her? Why or why not?</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <br />
    Yes, Wanda knew that girls were teasing her She would have known that the children intended to make fun of her poverty, and would have laughed at her whatever she might have said. This could have been the reason for her exaggerating everything whenever she answered their questions.<br />
