<span style="color: red;">1. You have been provided with three test tubes. One of them contains distilled water and the other two contain an acidic solution and a basic solution, respectively. If you are given only red litmus paper, how will you identify the contents of each test tube?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
If the colour of red litmus does not change then it is acid. If the colour of red litmus changes to blue then it is base. If there is slight change in the colour of red litmus (such as purple) then it is distilled water.<br />

<span style="color: red;">1. Why should curd and sour substances not be kept in brass and copper vessels?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Curd and other sour substances contain acids. Therefore, when they are&nbsp;kept in brass and copper vessels, the metal reacts with the acid to liberate hydrogen gas and harmful products, thereby spoiling the food.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">2. Which gas is usually liberated when an acid reacts with a metal? Illustrate with an example. How will you test for the presence of this gas?</span><br />

Take few pieces of zinc granules and add 5 ml of dilute H2SO4. Shake it and pass the gas produced into a soap solution. The bubbles of the soap solution are formed. These soap bubbles contain hydrogen gas.<br />
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;+ Zn &#8594; ZnSO<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;+ H<sub>2</sub> &#8593;<br />
We can test the evolved hydrogen gas by its burning with a pop sound when a candle is brought near the soap bubbles.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">3. Metal compound A reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce effervescence. The gas evolved extinguishes a burning candle. Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction if one of the compounds formed is calcium chloride.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: red;">1. Why do HCl, HNO<sub>3</sub>, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions while solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic character?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
When HCl or HNO<sub>3</sub> are mixed with water then they dissolve in water to form H<sup>+</sup> or H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ions which shows their acidic character. For example just see the following reactions<br />
<div>
HCl (aq) &#8594; H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;+ Cl<sup>-</sup></div>
<div>
H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;+ H<sub>2</sub>O &#8594; H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup></div>
When alcohols and glucose are mixed with water then they do not dissolve to form ions. Hence they do not show acidic character.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">2. Why does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The presence of hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) or hydronium (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) ions in the aqueous solution of an acid are responsible for conducting electricity.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">3. Why does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper because it has no Hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) in it.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">4. While diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be added to water and not water to the acid?</span><br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<b>Answer</b></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
Since the process of dissolving an acid in water is exothermic, it is always recommended that acid should be added to water. If it is done the other way, then it is possible that because of the large amount of heat generated, the mixture splashes out and causes burns.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">5. How is the concentration of hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) affected when a solution of an acid is diluted?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
When an acid is diluted, the concentration of hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) per unit volume decreases. This means that the strength of the acid decreases.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">6. How is the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH<sup>&#8722;</sup>) affected when excess base is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The concentration of hydroxide ions (OH<sup>&#8722;</sup>) would increase when excess base is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide.<br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red;">1. You have two solutions, A and B. The pH of solution A is 6 and pH of solution B is 8. Which solution has more hydrogen ion concentration? Which of this is acidic and which one is basic?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
A pH value of less than 7 indicates an acidic solution, while greater than 7 indicates a basic solution. Therefore, the solution with pH = 6 is acidic and has more hydrogen ion concentration than the solution of pH = 8 which is basic.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">2. What effect does the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> (aq)&nbsp;ions have on the nature of the solution?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
If the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> (aq) ions is increased (&gt;10-7) then the solution become acidic and if the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> (aq) ions is decreased (&lt;10-7) then the solution become basic in nature.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">3. Do basic solutions also have H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;(aq) ions? If yes, then why are these basic?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Yes, basic solution also has H<sup>+</sup> ions. However, their concentration is less as compared to the concentration of OH<sup>-</sup> ions that makes the solution basic.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">4. Under what soil condition do you think a farmer would treat the soil of his fields with quick lime (calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or chalk (calcium carbonate)?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
If the soil is acidic and improper for cultivation, then to increase the basicity of soil, the farmer would treat the soil with quick lime or slaked lime or chalk.<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red;">4. What will happen if a solution of sodium hydrocarbonate is heated? Give the equation of the reaction involved.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />

<span style="color: red;">6. Compounds such as alcohols and glucose also contain hydrogen but are not categorized as acids. Describe an activity to prove it.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Two nails are fitted on a cork and are kept it in a 100 mL beaker. The nails are then connected to the two terminals of a 6-volt battery through a bulb and a switch. Some dilute HCl is poured in the beaker and the current is switched on. The same experiment is then performed with glucose solution and alcohol solution.<br />
<br />
<div>
<u>Observations:</u><br />
It will be observed that the bulb glows in the HCl solution and does not glow in the glucose solution.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L9d-ZCz8ggQ/VOCiWcJ4inI/AAAAAAAADwE/uKRY1u7Xu9U/s1600/experiment-2.jpg" /></div>
<br />
<u>Result:</u><br />
HCl dissociates into H<sup>+</sup>and Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>ions. These ions conduct electricity in the solution resulting in the glowing of the bulb. On the other hand, the glucose solution does not dissociate into ions. Therefore, it does not conduct electricity.<br />
<u><br /></u>
<br />
<div>
<u>Conclusion:</u><br />
From this activity, it can be concluded that all acids contain hydrogen but not all compounds containing hydrogen are acids.<br />
That is why, though alcohols and glucose contain hydrogen, they are not categorised as acids.</div>
<br />
<span style="color: red;">7. Why does distilled water not conduct electricity, whereas rain water does?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Distilled water cannot conduct electricity because it does not contain ions while rain water conducts electricity as it contains ions due presence of dissolved salts in it.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">8. Why do acids not show acidic behaviour in the absence of water?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Acids do not show acidic behaviour in the absence of water because the dissociation of hydrogen ions from an acid occurs in the presence of water only.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">9. Five solutions A, B, C, D and E when tested with universal indicator showed pH as 4, 1, 11, 7 and 9, respectively. Which solution is</span><br />

<span style="color: red;">10. Equal lengths of magnesium ribbons are taken in test tubes A and B. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to test tube A, while acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) is added to test tube B. In which test tube will the fizzing occur more vigorously and why?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The fizzing will occur strongly in test tube A, in which hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added. This is because HCl is a stronger acid than&nbsp;CH<sub>3</sub>COOH&nbsp;and therefore produces hydrogen gas at a faster speed due to&nbsp;which fizzing occurs.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">11. Fresh milk has a pH of 6. How do you think the pH will change as it turns into curd? Explain your answer.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The pH of milk is 6. As it changes to curd, the pH will reduce because curd is acidic in nature. The acids present in it decrease the pH.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">12.A milkman adds a very small amount of baking soda to fresh milk.</span><br />
<span style="color: red;">(a) Why does he shift the pH of the fresh milk from 6 to slightly alkaline?</span><br />
<span style="color: red;">(b) Why does this milk take a long time to set as curd?</span><br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<b>Answer</b></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
(a) The milkman shifts the pH of the fresh milk from 6 to slightly alkaline because in alkaline condition, milk does not set as curd easily.<br />
<br />
(b) Since this milk is slightly basic than usual milk, acids produced to set the curd are neutralized by the base. Therefore, it takes a longer time for the curd to set.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">13. Plaster of Paris should be stored in a moisture-proof container. Explain why?</span><br />
