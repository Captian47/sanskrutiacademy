<span style="color: red;">1. What are the disadvantages of fossil fuels?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The disadvantages of fossil fuels are:<br />
&#8594; Burning of coal and petroleum produces a lot of pollutants causing air pollution.<br />
&#8594; Fossil fuels release oxides of carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, etc. that cause acid rain, which affects the soil fertility and potable water.<br />
&#8594; Burning of fossil fuels produce gases such as carbon dioxide that causes global warming.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">2. Why are we looking at alternate sources of energy?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Fossil fuels which are traditionally used by human beings everywhere as an energy sources are non-renewable sources of energy. These sources of energy are limited and will disappear after some time. They are being consumed at a large rate. Therefore, we should conserve the energy sources. Hence, we should look for alternate sources of energy.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">3. How has the traditional use of wind and water energy been modified for our convenience?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Earlier, the windmills were used to harness wind energy to do mechanical work such as lifting/drawing water from a well. Today, windmills are used to generate electricity.In windmills, the kinetic energy of wind is harnessed and converted into electricity.<br />
Water energy which was used for transportation before is now a good source to generate electricity. Dams has been constructed on river for generating electricity.&nbsp;Waterfalls were used as a source of potential energy which was converted to electricity with the help of turbines.<br />

<span style="color: red;">1. What kind of mirror - concave, convex or plain - would be best suited for use in a solar cooker? Why?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
A concave mirror is used in a solar cooker as it uses heat of the sunlight to cook food. The mirror focuses all the incident sunlight at a point. The temperature at that point increases, thereby cooking and heating the food placed at that point.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">2. What are the limitations of the energy that can be obtained from the oceans?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The forms of energy that can be obtained from the ocean are tidal energy, wave energy, and ocean thermal energy. There are several limitations in order to harness these energies.<br />
&#8594; Tidal energy depends on the relative positioning of the Earth, moon, and the Sun.<br />
&#8594; High dams are required to be built to convert tidal energy into electricity.<br />
&#8594; Very strong waves are required to obtain electricity from wave energy.<br />
&#8594; To harness ocean thermal energy efficiently, the difference in the temperature of surface water (hot) and the water at depth (cold) must be 20ÂºC or more.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">3. What is geothermal energy?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Geothermal power plants use heat of the Earth to generate electricity. This heat energy of the Earth is known as geothermal energy.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">4. What are the advantages of nuclear energy?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The advantages of nuclear energy are:<br />
&#8594; Large amount of energy is produced per unit mass.<br />
&#8594; It does not produce smoke. It is a clean energy.<br />
&#8594; Fission of one atom of uranium produces 10 million times the energy released by burning of one atom of carbon.<br />
&#8594; Fusion of four hydrogen atoms produces huge amount of energy approximately equal to 27 MeV.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">1. Can any source of energy be pollution-free? Why or why not?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
No source of energy can be pollution-free.&nbsp;Every source of energy has some type of pollution. For example, the wastes of nuclear reaction are very dangerous to the environment.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">2. Hydrogen has been used as a rocket fuel. Would you consider it a cleaner fuel than CNG? Why or why not?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Hydrogen gas is cleaner than CNG. CNG contains hydrocarbons. Therefore, it has carbon contents. Carbon is a form of pollutant present in CNG. On the other hand, hydrogen is waste-free. The fusion of hydrogen does not produce any waste. Hence, hydrogen is cleaner than CNG.<br />

<span style="color: red;">1. Name two energy sources that you would consider to be renewable. Give reasons for your choices.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Two renewable sources of energy are :<br />
&#8594; Sun: The energy derived from the Sun is known as solar energy. Solar energy is produced by the fusion of hydrogen into helium, fusion of helium into other heavy elements, and so on. A large amount of hydrogen and helium is present in the Sun. The Sun has billions years more to burn. Therefore solar energy is a renewable source of energy.<br />
&#8594; Wind: Wind energy is derived from fast blowing air. Wind energy is harnessed by windmills in order to generate electricity. Air blows because of uneven heating of the Earth. Since the heating of the Earth will continue forever therefore wind energy will also be available forever.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">2. Give the names of two energy sources that you would consider to be exhaustible. Give reasons for your choices.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Two exhaustible energy sources are as follows:<br />
&#8594; Coal: It is produced from dead remains of plants and animals that remain buried under the earth's crust for millions of years. It takes millions of years to produce coal. Industrialization has increased the demand of coal. However, coal cannot replenish within a short period of time. Hence, it is a non-renewable or exhaustible source of energy.<br />
&#8594; Wood: It is obtained from forests. Deforestation at a faster rate has caused a reduction in the number of forests on the Earth. It takes hundreds of years to grow a forest. If deforestation is continued at this rate, then there would be no wood left on the Earth. Hence, wood is an exhaustible source of energy.<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red;">4. Compare and contrast fossil fuels and the Sun as direct sources of energy.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Fossil fuels are energy sources, such as coal and petroleum, obtained from underneath the Earth's crust. They are directly available to human beings for use. Hence, fossil fuels are the direct source of energy. These are limited in amount. These are non-renewable sources of energy because these cannot be replenished in nature. Fossil fuels take millions of years for their formation. If the present fossil fuel of the Earth gets exhausted, its formation will take several years. Fossil fuels are also very costly.<br />
On the other hand, solar energy is a renewable and direct source of energy. The Sun has been shining for several years and will do so for the next five billion years. Solar energy is available free of cost to all in unlimited amount. It replenishes in the Sun itself.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">5. Compare and contrast bio-mass and hydro electricity as sources of energy.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Bio-mass and hydro-electricity both are renewable sources of energy. Bio-mass is derived from dead plants and animal wastes. Hence, it is naturally replenished. It is the result of natural processes. Wood, gobargas, etc. are some of the examples of bio-mass.<br />
Hydro-electricity, on the other hand, is obtained from the potential energy stored in water at a height. Energy from it can be produced again and again. It is harnessed from water and obtained from mechanical processes.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">6. What are the limitations of extracting energy from -</span><br />
<span style="color: red;">(a) the wind? (b) waves? (c) tides?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
(a) A windmill requires wind of speed more than 15 km/h to generate electricity from wind energy also large numbers of windmills are required to get feasible output which covers a large area.<br />
<br />
(b) Very strong ocean waves are required in order to extract energy from waves.<br />
<br />
(c) Very high tides are required in order to extract energy from tides. Also, occurrence of tides depends on the relative positions of the Sun, moon, and the Earth.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">7. On what basis would you classify energy sources as</span><br />
<span style="color: red;">(a) renewable and non-renewable?</span><br />
<span style="color: red;">(b) exhaustible and inexhaustible?</span><br />
<span style="color: red;">Are the options given in (a) and (b) the same?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
(a) The source of energy that replenishes in nature is known as renewable source of energy. Sun, wind, moving water, bio-mass, etc. are some of the examples of renewable sources of energy.<br />
The source of energy that does not replenish in nature is known as non-renewable source of energy. Coal, petroleum, natural gas, etc. are some of the examples of non-renewable sources of energy.<br />
<br />
(b) Exhaustible sources are those sources of energy, which will deplete and exhaust after a few hundred years. Coal, petroleum, etc. are the exhaustible sources of energy.<br />
Inexhaustible resources of energy are those sources, which will not exhaust in future. These are unlimited. Bio-mass is one of the inexhaustible sources of energy.<br />
<br />
Yes. The options given in (a) and (b) are the same.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">8. What are the qualities of an ideal source of energy?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
An ideal source of energy must be:<br />
&#8594; Economical<br />
&#8594; Easily accessible<br />
&#8594; Smoke/pollution free<br />
&#8594; Easy to store and transport<br />
&#8594; Able to produce huge amount of heat and energy on burning<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">9.&nbsp;What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a solar cooker? Are there places where solar cookers would have limited utility?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Solar cooker uses Sun's energy to heat and cook food. It is inexhaustible and clean renewable source of energy. It is free for all and available in unlimited amount. Hence, operating a solar cooker is not expensive.<br />
Disadvantage of a solar cooker is that it is very expensive. It does not work without sunlight. Hence, on cloudy day, it becomes useless.<br />
The places where the days are too short or places with cloud covers round the year, have limited utility for solar cooker.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">10. What are the environmental consequences of the increasing demand for energy? What steps would you suggest to reduce energy consumption?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Industrialization increases the demand for energy. Fossil fuels are easily accessible sources of energy that fulfil this demand. The increased use of fossil fuels has a harsh effect on the environment. Too much exploitation of fossil fuels increases the level of green house gas content in the atmosphere, resulting in global warming and a rise in the sea level.<br />
It is not possible to completely reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. However, some measures can be taken such as using electrical appliances wisely and not wasting electricity. Unnecessary usage of water should be avoided. Public transport system with mass transit must be adopted on a large scale. These small steps may help in reducing the consumption of natural resources and conserving them.<div>
