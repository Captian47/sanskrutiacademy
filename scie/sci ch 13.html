<span style="color: red;">1.&nbsp;Why does a compass needle get deflected when brought near a bar magnet?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The needle of a compass is a small magnet. That&#8217;s why when a compass needle is brought near a bar magnet, its magnetic field lines interact with that of the bar magnet. Hence, a compass needle gets deflected.<br />

<span style="color: red;">2. List the properties of magnetic lines of force.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The properties of magnetic lines of force are as follows.<br />
&#8594; Magnetic field lines emerge from the north pole.<br />
&#8594; They merge at the south pole.<br />
&#8594; The direction of field lines inside the magnet is from the south pole to the north pole.<br />
&#8594; Magnetic lines do not intersect with each other.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<span style="color: red;">3. Why don't two magnetic lines of force intersect each other?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The two magnetic field lines do not intersect each other because if they do it means at the point of intersect the compass needle is showing two different directions which is not possible.<br />

<span style="color: red;">1. Consider a circular loop of wire lying in the plane of the table. Let the current pass through the loop clockwise. Apply the right-hand rule to find out the direction of the magnetic field inside and outside the loop.</span><br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<b>Answer</b></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
Inside the loop = Pierce inside the table<br />
Outside the loop = Appear to emerge out from the table<br />
For downward direction of current flowing in the circular loop, the direction of magnetic field lines will be as if they are emerging from the table outside the loop and merging in the table inside the loop. Similarly, for upward direction of current flowing in the circular loop, the direction of magnetic field lines will be as if they are emerging from the table outside the loop and merging in the table inside the loop, as shown in the given figure.<br />

<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<b>Answer</b></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
Fleming's left hand rule states that if we arrange the thumb, the centre finger, and the forefinger of the left hand at right angles to each other, then the thumb points towards the direction of the magnetic force, the centre finger gives the direction of current, and the forefinger points in the direction of magnetic field.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">2. What is the principle of an electric motor?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The principle of an electric motor is based on the magnetic effect of electric current. A current-carrying loop experiences a force and rotates when placed in a magnetic field. The direction of rotation of the loop is according to the Fleming&#8217;s left-hand rule.<br />

<br />
The different ways to induce current in a coil are as follows:<br />
&#8594; If a coil is moved rapidly between the two poles of a horse-shoe magnet, then an electric current is induced in the coil.<br />

<span style="color: red;">1. Name two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and appliances.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and appliances are<br />
&#8594; Electric Fuse: An electric fuse is connected in series it protects the circuit from overloading and prevents it from short circuiting.<br />
&#8594; Proper earthing of all electric circuit in which any leakage of current in an electric appliance is transferred to the ground and people using the appliance do not get the shock.<br />

<div>
<span style="color: red;">2.&nbsp;An electric oven of 2 kW is operated in a domestic electric circuit (220 <i>V</i>) that has a current rating of 5 A. What result do you expect? Explain.</span></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<b>Answer</b></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
Current drawn by the electric oven can be obtained by the expression,<br />
<i>P</i> = <i>VI</i><br />
<div>
Where,<br />
Current = <i>I</i><br />
Power of the oven, P = 2 kW = 2000 W<br />
Voltage supplied, <i>V</i> = 220 <i>V</i></div>
<i>I</i> = 2000/220 <i>V </i>= 9.09 A<br />
Hence, the current drawn by the electric oven is 9.09 A, which exceeds the safe limit of the circuit. Fuse element of the electric fuse will melt and break the circuit.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">3. What precaution should be taken to avoid the overloading of domestic electric circuits?</span></div>
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The precautions that should be taken to avoid the overloading of domestic circuits are as follows:<br />
&#8594; Too many appliances should not be connected to a single socket.<br />
&#8594; Too many appliances should not be used at the same time.<br />
&#8594; Faulty appliances should not be connected in the circuit.<br />
&#8594; Fuse should be connected in the circuit.<br />

<span style="color: red;">8. How does a solenoid behave like a magnet? Can you determine the north and south poles of a current-carrying solenoid with the help of a bar magnet? Explain.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
A solenoid is a long coil of circular loops of insulated copper wire. Magnetic field lines are produced around the solenoid when a current is allowed to flow through it. The magnetic field produced by it is similar to the magnetic field of a bar magnet. The field lines produced in a current-carrying solenoid is shown in the following figure.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<img alt="Magnetic Field in current carrying solenoid" border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_SEMObBCLE4/VOm2Hx4iz2I/AAAAAAAAEAw/_SagnhoksMw/s1600/filed-lines-around-current-carrying-solenoid.JPG" title="Magnetic Field in current carrying solenoid" /></div>
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
</div>
In the above figure, when the north pole of a bar magnet is brought near the end connected to the negative terminal of the battery, the solenoid repels the bar magnet. Since like poles repel each other, the end connected to the negative terminal of the battery behaves as the north pole of the solenoid and the other end behaves as a south pole. Hence, one end of the solenoid behaves as a north pole and the other end behaves as a south pole.<br />

<span style="color: red;">9. When is the force experienced by a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field largest?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The force experienced by a current-currying conductor is the maximum when the direction of current is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">10. Imagine that you are sitting in a chamber with your back to one wall. An electron beam, moving horizontally from back wall towards the front wall, is deflected by a strong magnetic field to your right side. What is the direction of magnetic field?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The direction of the magnetic field is vertically downwards. The direction of current is from the front wall to the back wall because negatively charged electrons are moving from back wall to the front wall. The direction of magnetic force is rightward. Hence, using Fleming's left hand rule, it can be concluded that the direction of magnetic field inside the chamber is downward.<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<u>Principle:</u>&nbsp;It works on the principle of the magnetic effect of current. A current-carrying coil rotates in a magnetic field.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<u>Working:</u>&nbsp;When a current is allowed to flow through the coil MNST by closing the switch, the coil starts rotating anti-clockwise. This happens because a downward force acts on length MN and at the same time, an upward force acts on length ST. As a result, the coil rotates anti-clockwise.</div>
Current in the length MN flows from M to N and the magnetic field acts from left to right, normal to length MN. Therefore, according to Fleming's left hand rule, a downward force acts on the length MN. Similarly, current in the length ST flows from S to T and the magnetic field acts from left to right, normal to the flow of current. Therefore, an upward force acts on the length ST. These two forces cause the coil to rotate anti-clockwise.<br />
After half a rotation, the position of MN and ST interchange. The half-ring D comes in contact with brush A and half-ring C comes in contact with brush B. Hence, the direction of current in the coil MNST gets reversed.<br />
The current flows through the coil in the direction TSNM. The reversal of current through the coil MNST repeats after each half rotation. As a result, the coil rotates unidirectional.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
The split rings help to reverse the direction of current in the circuit. These are called the commutator.<br />

<br />

If the current in the coil A is changed, will some current be induced in the coil B? Give reason.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Two circular coils A and B are placed close to each other. When the current in coil A is changed, the magnetic field associated with it also changes. As a result, the magnetic field around coil B also changes. This change in magnetic field lines around coil B induces an electric current in it. This is called electromagnetic induction.<br />

<span style="color: red;">16. Explain the underlying principle and working of an electric generator by drawing a labelled diagram. What is the function of brushes?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
<u>Principle:</u>&nbsp;An electric generator works on the principle of electromagnetic induction phenomenon. According to it, whenever a coil is rotated between the poles of a magnet, an induced current is set up in the coil, whose direction is given by Fleming&#8217;s right hand rule.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<u>Working:</u> Let in the beginning, as shown in Fig. brushes B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> are kept pressed separately on rings R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> respectively. Let the axle attached to the rings is rotated such that arm AB of the coil moves up and arm CD moves down in the magnetic field. Due to rotation of arms AB and CD induced currents are set up in them. As per Fleming&#8217;s right hand rule induced currents in these arms are along the directions AB and CD. Thus an induced current flows along ABCD and current in the external circuit flows from B<sub>2</sub> to B<sub>1</sub>.<br />
After half a rotation, arm AB starts moving down and the arm CD upward. Therefore, directions of induced currents in these arms change. Thus net induced current now becomes in the direction DCBA. In the external circuit now current flows from B<sub>1</sub> to B<sub>2</sub>. Thus after every half rotation current changes its direction and an alternating current is obtained from the generator.</div>
<div>
<br />
<u>Function of Brushes:</u> Brushes are kept pressed on the two slip rings separately. Outer ends of the brushes are connected to the galvanometer (or the external load). Thus brushes help in transferring current from the coil ABCD to the external circuit.</div>
<br />
<span style="color: red;">17. When does an electric short circuit occur?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
If the insulation of the wires used in the circuit is damaged or the appliance used is faulty due to which the live wire and the neutral wire comes in direct contact as a result current in the circuit rises and the short circuit occurs.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">18. What is the function of an earth wire? Why is it necessary to earth metallic appliances?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The metallic body of electric appliances is connected to the earth by means of earth wire so that any leakage of electric current is transferred to the ground. This prevents any electric shock to the user. That is why earthing of the electrical appliances is necessary.<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />
