<span style="color: red;">2.Explain the meanings of malleable and ductile.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Malleable:Substances that can be beaten into thin sheets are called malleable. For example, most of the metals are malleable.<br />
Ductile: Substances that can be drawn into thin wires are called ductile. For example, most of the metals are ductile.<br />

<span style="color: red;">1. Why is sodium kept immersed in kerosene oil?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Sodium is high reactive element. If it is kept in open it can explosively react with oxygen to catch fire. Hence to prevent accidental damage sodium is immersed in kerosene oil.<br />

<span style="color: red;">(a) How could you use them to distinguish between samples of metals and non-metals?</span><br />
<span style="color: red;">(b) Assess the usefulness of these tests in distinguishing between metals and non-metals.</span></div>
<br />
<b>Anwer</b><br />
<br />
(a) With the hammer, we can beat the sample and if it can be beaten into thin sheets (that is, it is malleable), then it is a metal otherwise a non-metal. Similarly, we can use the battery, bulb, wires, and a switch to set up a circuit with the sample. If the sample conducts electricity, then it is a metal otherwise a non-metal.<br />
<br />
(b) The above tests are useful in distinguishing between metals and non-metals as these are based on the physical properties. No chemical reactions are involved in these tests.<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red;">10. State two ways to prevent the rusting of iron.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Two ways to prevent the rusting of iron are:<br />
&#8594; Oiling, greasing, or painting: By applying oil, grease, or paint, the surface becomes water proof and the moisture and oxygen present in the air cannot come into direct contact with iron. Hence, rusting is prevented.<br />
&#8594; Galvanisation:An iron article is coated with a layer of zinc metal, which prevents the iron to come in contact with oxygen and moisture. Hence, rusting is prevented.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">11. What type of oxides are formed when non-metals combine with oxygen?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
When non-metals are combined with oxygen then neutral or acidic oxides are formed. Examples of acidic oxides are NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> and examples of neutral oxides are NO, CO etc.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">12. Give reasons</span><br />
<span style="color: red;"><br /></span> <span style="color: red;">(a) Platinum, gold and silver are used to make jewellery.</span><br />
<div>
<span style="color: red;">(b) Sodium, potassium and lithium are stored under oil.</span><br />
<span style="color: red;">(c) Aluminium is a highly reactive metal, yet it is used to make utensils for cooking.</span><br />
<span style="color: red;">(d) Carbonate and sulphide ores are usually converted into oxides during the process of extraction.</span></div>
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
(a) Platinum, gold, and silver are used to make jewellery because they are very lustrous. Also, they are very less reactive and do not corrode easily.<br />
<br />
(b) Sodium, potassium, and lithium are very reactive metals and react very vigorously with air as well as water.Therefore, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil in order to prevent their contact with air and moisture.<br />
<br />
(c) Though aluminium is a highly reactive metal, it is resistant to corrosion. This is because aluminium reacts with oxygen present in air to form a thin layer of aluminium oxide. This oxide layer is very stable and prevents further reaction of aluminium with oxygen. Also, it is light in weight and a good conductor of heat. Hence, it is used to make cooking utensils.<br />
<br />
(d) Carbonate and sulphide ores are usually converted into oxides during the process of extraction because metals can be easily extracted from their oxides rather than from their carbonates and sulphides.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">13. You must have seen tarnished copper vessels being cleaned with lemon or tamarind juice. Explain why these sour substances are effective in cleaning the vessels.</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Copper reacts with moist carbon dioxide in air to form copper carbonate and as a result, copper vessel loses its shiny brown surface forming a green layer of copper carbonate. The citric acid present in the lemon or tamarind neutralises the basis copper carbonate and dissolves the layer. That is why, tarnished copper vessels are cleaned with lemon or tamarind juice to give the surface of the copper vessel its characteristic lustre.<br />

An unsuspecting lady gave a set of gold bangles to him which he dipped in a particular solution. The bangles sparkled like new but their weight was reduced drastically. The lady was upset but after a futile argument the man beat a hasty retreat. Can you play the detective to find out the nature of the solution he had used?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
The solution he had used was Aqua regia. Aqua regia is Latin word which means &#8216;Royal Water&#8217;. It is the mixture of concentrated Hydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in the ratio of 3:1. It is capable of dissolving metals like Gold and Platinum. Since the outer layer of the gold bangles is dissolved in aqua regia so their weight was reduced drastically.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">16. Give reasons why copper is used to make hot water tanks and not steel (an alloy of iron).</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
Copper does not react with cold water, hot water, or steam. However, iron reacts with steam. If the hot water tanks are made of steel (an alloy of iron), then iron would react vigorously with the steam formed from hot water. 3Fe&nbsp;+ 4H<sub>2</sub>O &#8594; Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;+ H<sub>2</sub>O<br />
That is why copper is used to make hot water tanks, and not steel.<br />
