    <span style="color: red;">1.&nbsp;In situations with high risks, credit might create further problems for the borrower. Explain.</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <br />
    In situations with high risks, credit might create further problems for the borrower. This is also known as a debt-trap. Taking credit involves an interest rate on the loan and if this is not paid back, then the borrower is forced to give up his collateral or asset used as the guarantee, to the lender. If a farmer takes a loan for crop production and the crop fails, loan payment becomes impossible.&nbsp;To repay the loan the farmer may sell a part of his land making the situation worse than before.&nbsp;Thus, in situations with high risks, if the risks affect a borrower badly, then he ends up losing more than he would have without the loan.<br />

    <span style="color: red;">2.&nbsp;How does money solve the problem of double coincidence of wants? Explain with an example of your own.</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <br />
    In a barter system where goods are directly exchanged without the use of money, double coincidence of wants is an essential feature. By serving as a medium of exchanges, money removes the need for double coincidence of wants and the difficulties associated with the barter system. For example, it is no longer necessary for the farmer to look for a book publisher who will buy his cereals at the same time sell him books. All he has to do is find a buyer for his cereals. If he has exchanged his cereals for money, he can purchase any goods or service which he needs. This is because money acts as a medium of exchange.<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22.8571434020996px;">&nbsp;</span><br />

    <span style="color: red;">3.&nbsp;How do banks mediate between those who have surplus money and those who need money?</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <br />
    Banks keep small portion&nbsp;deposits as cash (15%) for themselves (to pay the depositors on demand). They use the major portion of the deposits to extend loans to those who need money. In this way banks mediate between those who have surplus money and those who need money.<br />

    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <br />
    The banks might not be willing to lend certain borrowers due to the following reasons:<br />
    &#8594; Banks require proper documents and collateral as security against loans. Some persons fail to meet these requirements.<br />
    &#8594; The borrowers who have not repaid previous loans, the banks might not be willing to lend them further.<br />

    <span style="color: red;">8. In what ways does the Reserve Bank of India supervise the functions of Banks? Why is this necessary?  </span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <br />
    The Reserve Bank of India supervises the functions of banks in a number of ways:<br />
    &#8594; The commercial banks are required to hold part of their cash reserves with their RBI. RBI ensures that the banks maintain a minimum cash balance out of the deposits they receive.<br />
    &#8594; RBI observes that the banks give loans not just to profit making businesses and traders but also to small cultivators, small scale industries, small borrowers etc.<br />
    &#8594; The commercial banks have to submit information to the RBI on how much they are lending, to whom, at what interest rate etc.<br />
    This is necessary to ensure equality in the economy of the country and protect especially small depositors, farmers, small scale industries, small borrowers etc. In this process RBI also acts as the lender of the last resort to the banks.<br />

    <span style="color: red;">11.&nbsp;In India, about 80 per cent of farmers are small farmers, who need credit for cultivation.</span><br />
    <span style="color: red;">(a) Why might banks be unwilling to lend to small farmers?</span><br />
    <span style="color: red;">(b) What are the other sources from which the small farmers can borrow?</span><br />
    <span style="color: red;">(c) Explain with an example how the terms of credit can be unfavourable for the small farmer.</span><br />
    <span style="color: red;">(d) Suggest some ways by which small farmers can get cheap credit.</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <br />
    (a) Bank loans require proper documents and collateral as security against loans. But most of the times the small farmers lack in providing such documents and collateral. Besides, at times they even fail to repay the loan in time because of the uncertainty of the crop. So, banks might be unwilling to lend to small farmers.<br />
    <div>
    <br />
    (b) Apart from bank, the small farmers can borrow from local money lenders, agricultural traders, big landlords, cooperatives, SHGs etc.</div>
    <div>
    <br />
    (c) The terms of credit can be unfavorable for the small farmer which can be explained by the following -<br />
    Ramu, a small farmer borrows from a local moneylender at a high rate of interest i.e. 3 per cent to grow rice.  But the crop is hit by drought and it fails. As a result Ramu has to sell a part of land to repay the loan. Now his condition becomes worse than before.</div>
    <div>
    <br />
    (d) The small farmers can get cheap credit from the different sources like &#8211; Banks, Agricultural Cooperatives, and SHGs. </div>
