    (ii)&nbsp;A mineral is a homogeneous, naturally occurring substance with a definable interior structure.<br />
    <br />
    (iii)&nbsp;In igneous and metamorphic rocks, molten/liquid and gaseous minerals are forced upwards into the cracks. They then solidify and form veins or lodes.<br />
    <br />
    (iv)&nbsp;It takes millions of years for the formation of minerals. Compared to the present rate of consumption, the replenishment rate of minerals is very slow. Hence, mineral resources are finite and non-renewable. Due to this, it is important that we conserve the mineral resources.<br />

    <span style="color: red;">3.&nbsp;Answer the following questions.</span><br />
    <span style="color: red;"><br /></span> <span style="color: red;">(i) Describe the distribution of coal in India.</span><br />
    <span style="color: red;"><br /></span> <span style="color: red;">(ii) Why do you think that solar energy has a bright future in India?</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <br />
    &#8594; The major resources of metallurgical coal belong to the Gondwana age and are located&nbsp;mainly in the north eastern part of the peninsula.<br />
    <div>
    &#8594; Rich reserves of coal are found in the&nbsp;Damodar Valley region in the states of West Bengal and Jharkhand. Raniganj in West&nbsp;Bengal and Jharia and Bokaro in Jharkhand are important coalfields. One third of the total&nbsp;production comes from here.<br />
    &#8594; Coal is also found in the Godavari, Mahanadi, Son and Wardha valleys. Korba in&nbsp;Chhattisgarh, Singrauli and Penah-kanhan valley in Madhya Pradesh, Talcher in Orissa,&nbsp;Kamptee and Chandrapur in Maharashtra and Singareni of Andhra Pradesh are important&nbsp;coal mines.<br />
    &#8594; Tertiary coal occur in the north eastern states of Meghalaya, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh&nbsp;and Nagaland.<br />
    &#8594; Principal lignite reserves are found in Neyveli in Tamil Nadu.</div>
    <br />
    (ii)&nbsp;Solar energy has a bright future in India because &#8211;<br />
    &#8594; India being a tropical country receives sunlight in abundance throughout the year.<br />
    &#8594; Solar plants can be easily established in rural and remote areas.<br />
    &#8594; It will minimize the dependence of rural households on firewood and dunk cakes which in turn will contribute to environmental conservation and adequate supply of manure in agriculture.<br />
