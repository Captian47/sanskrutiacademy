    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <br />
    (i) Tea is an important beverage crop. This plant grows well in tropical or sub tropical climates, and deep and fertile well-drained soil which is rich in humus and organic matter.<br />
    <br />
    (ii)&nbsp;Rice is a staple food crop of India. It grows in the plains of north and north-east India, coastal areas and the deltaic regions.<br />
    <br />
    (iii)&nbsp;The various institutional reform programmes introduced by the government for the benefit of farmers are:<br />
    &#8594; Crop insurance against drought, flood, fire etc.<br />
    &#8594;&nbsp;Minimum Support Price policy.<br />
    &#8594; Subsidy on agricultural inputs and resources such as power and fertilisers.<br />
    &#8594;&nbsp;Kissan Credit Card and Personal Accident Insurance Scheme.<br />
    <br />
    (iv)&nbsp;A declining area of land under cultivation coupled with increasing population have many consequesnces. These are:<br />
    &#8594;&nbsp;Food shortage for the rising population.<br />
    &#8594;&nbsp;Rise in price of food grains.<br />
    &#8594;&nbsp;Unemployment and loss of livelihood for farmers.<br />
    &#8594;&nbsp;Shortage of supply of raw material for agro-industries.<br />
    &#8594;&nbsp;Adverse affect on export trade as agricultural products comprise a major section of&nbsp;international trade.<br />

    <span style="color: red;"><br /></span> <span style="color: red;">(i) Suggest the initiative taken by the government to ensure the increase in agricultural production.</span><br />
    <span style="color: red;"><br /></span> <span style="color: red;">(ii) Describe the impact of globalisation on Indian agriculture.</span><br />
    <span style="color: red;"><br /></span> <span style="color: red;">(iii) Describe the geographical conditions required for the growth of rice.</span><br />
    <br />
    <b>Answer</b><br />
    <br />
    Various initiative taken by the government to ensure the increase in agricultural production are:<br />
    &#8594; Collectivisation, consolidation of holdings, cooperation and abolition of Zamindari etc. were given priority to bring about institutional reforms in the country after independence.<br />
    &#8594; Land Reform was the main focus of our &#8216;First Five Year Plan&#8217;.<br />
    &#8594; The Green Revolution was based on the use of package technology and the White Revolution were some of the strategies initiated to improve the lot of Indian agriculture.<br />
    &#8594; Minimum Support Price policy, provision for crop insurance, subsidy on agricultural inputs and resources such as power and fertilizers, Grameen Banks, Kissan Credit Card and Personal Accident Insurance Scheme are also some of the reforms bought by Indian Government.<br />

    (ii)&nbsp;The impact of globalisation on Indian agriculture has been felt since colonial times. Raw cotton and spices were important export items from India. In 1917, Indian farmers revolted in Champaran against being forced to grow indigo in place of foodgrains, in order to supply dye to Britain's flourishing textile industry. Thus, globalisation has had its boons and banes for Indian agriculture.<br />
    Post liberalisation, Indian farmers face new challenges in the form of competition from highly subsidised agriculture of developed nations. This prompts the need for making Indian agriculture successful and profitable by improving the conditions of small and marginal farmers, countering the negative effects of Green Revolution, developing and promoting organic farming, and diversifying cropping pattern from cereals to high-value crops.</div>
    <br />
    (iii)&nbsp;The geographical conditions required for growth of rice are as follows :<br />
    &#8594; It is a kharif crop and requires hot and humid climate for cultivation. Temperature above&nbsp;25&#176;C and high humidity with annual rainfall above 100 cm are favourable for growth&nbsp;of rice.<br />
    &#8594; Rich alluvial soils of the floodplains and deltaic areas which are renewed every years are&nbsp;ideal for rice cultivation.<br />
    &#8594; Rice requires abundant rainfall or good water supply through irrigation and flooded fields&nbsp;during the earlier part of its growing season in June-July.<br />
    &#8594; Plenty of cheap labour as most of the farming involves manual labour.<br />
