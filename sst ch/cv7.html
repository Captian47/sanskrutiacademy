<span style="color: red;">1. How does democracy produce an accountable, responsive and legitimate government?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Answer</b><br />
<br />
&#8594; Democracy produces an accountable government:&nbsp;Democracy produces an accountable governments, as the people has the right in choose their representatives through the electoral process. These elected representatives form the government and participate in the decision-making process on behalf of the people. If these elected representatives not work properly, people have a chance to not elect them in next election.<br />
&#8594;&nbsp;Democracy Produces Responsive Government:&nbsp;Democratic governments are elected by the people and are responsible towards the people and Parliament. These governments promote the formation of public opinion and take care of the needs and expectations of the people.<br />
&#8594; Democracy Produces Legitimate Government:&nbsp;A democratic government is people&#8217;s own&nbsp;government. People wish to be ruled by representatives elected by them. They also believe&nbsp;that democracy is suitable for their country. Democracy&#8217;s ability to generate its own&nbsp;support is itself an outcome that cannot be ignored.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: red;">2.&nbsp;What are the conditions under which democracies accommodate social diversities?</span><br />

<b>Answer</b><br />

Democracies accommodate social diversities when it is well understood that democracy is not just the rule of the majority, and that the rule of the majority is not just the rule of a single religious or social community.<br />

<span style="color: red;">3.&nbsp;Give arguments to support or oppose the following assertions:</span></div>
<div>
<span style="color: red;">&#8226; Industrialised countries can afford democracy but the poor need dictatorship to become rich.</span></div>
<div>
<span style="color: red;">&#8226; Democracy can't reduce inequality of incomes between different citizens.<br />&#8226; Government in poor countries should spend less on poverty reduction, health, education and spend more on industries and infrastructure.<br />&#8226; In democracy all citizens have one vote, which means that there is absence of any domination and conflict.</span><br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
</ul>
<div>
<b>Answer</b></div>
</div>
<br />
&#8226; This statement is incorrect as can be seen from the examples of India and Zimbabwe. In 1947, India was included in the Third World nations, but now, it is one of the fast-growing economies in the world. On the other hand, Zimbabwe, which was a fairly prosperous nation, has run into huge international debt with the progression of Robert Mugabe's regime.<br />
<br />
<div>
&#8226; Democracy can't reduce inequality of incomes between different citizens. This statement is incorrect. The Minimum Wages Act enacted by the government and other policies which regulate the basic price at which agricultural producers and small industries sell their goods, have helped increase the per capita income of the country, thereby making its citizens more prosperous.</div>
<div>
&#8226; Government in poor countries should spend less on poverty reduction, health, education and spend more on industries and infrastructure. This is not a wise option as in poor countries, the people cannot afford health and education services.</div>
<div>
&#8226; In democracy all citizens have one vote, which means that there is absence of any domination and conflict. This is not true as conflict can be eliminated only in an ideal situation. In real democracies, though every person has one vote, there are divisions among the people. These divisions lead to conflict.<br />

<ul style="text-align: left;">
</ul>
<div>
<b>Answer</b></div>
</div>
<br />
&#8226; The challenge to democracy in the first statement is to provide equal status to all its citizens in spite of their caste.</div>
<div>
&#8226; The challenge to democracy in the second instance is providing farmers with subsidies which will help them to earn profits and have a satisfactory level of livelihood.</div>
<div>
&#8226; The challenge to democracy is to preserve the people's trust in government arms like the police.<br />
