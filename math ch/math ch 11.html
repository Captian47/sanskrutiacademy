We know that radius of the circle is perpendicular to the tangents.<br />
Sum of all the 4 angles of quadrilateral = 360&#176;<br />
&#8756; Angle between the radius (&#8736;O) &nbsp;= 360&#176; - (90&#176;&nbsp;+ 90&#176;&nbsp;+ 60&#176;) = 120&#176;<br />
Steps of Construction:<br />
<u>Step I:</u> A point Q is taken on the circumference of the circle and OQ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is joined. OQ is radius of the circle.<br />
<u>Step II:</u> Draw another radius OR making an angle equal to 120&#176; with &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the previous one.<br />
<u>Step III:</u> A point P is taken outside the circle. QP and PR are joined &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;which is perpendicular OQ and OR.<br />
Thus, QP and PR are the required tangents inclined to each other at an angle of 60&#176;.<br />
<br />
Justification:<br />
<br />
Sum of all angles in the quadrilateral PQOR = 360&#176;<br />
&#8736;QOR&nbsp;+&nbsp;&#8736;ORP&nbsp;+&nbsp;&#8736;OQR&nbsp;+&nbsp;&#8736;RPQ = 360&#176;<br />
&#8658; 120&#176;&nbsp;+ 90&#176;&nbsp;+&nbsp;90&#176;&nbsp;+ &#8736;RPQ = 360&#176;<br />
&#8658;&#8736;RPQ = 360&#176; - 300&#176;<br />
&#8658;&#8736;RPQ = 60&#176;<br />
Hence, QP and PR are tangents inclined to each other at an angle of 60&#176;.<br />

Steps of Construction:<br />
<u>Step I:</u> A line segment AB of 8 cm is drawn.<br />
<u>Step II:</u> With A as centre and radius equal to 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cm, a circle is drawn which cut the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;line at point O.<br />
<u>Step III:</u> With B as a centre and radius equal to &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3 cm, a circle is drawn.<br />
<u>Step IV:</u> With O as a centre and OA as a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; radius, a circle is drawn which &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; intersect the previous two circles at P, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Q and R, S.<br />
<u>Step V:</u> AP, AQ, BR and BS are joined.<br />
Thus, AP, AQ, BR and BS are the required tangents.<br />
<br />
Justification:<br />
&#8736;BPA = 90&#176; (Angle in the semi circle)<br />
<div>
&#8756; AP &#8869; PB<br />
Therefor, BP is the radius of the circle then&nbsp;AP&nbsp;has to be a tangent of the circle.&nbsp;</div>

Steps of Construction:<br />
<u>Step I:</u> A ΔABC is drawn.<br />
<u>Step II:</u> Perpendicular to AC is drawn to point B &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;which intersected it at D.</div>
<u>Step III:</u> With O as a centre and OC as a radius, a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; circle is drawn. The circle through B, C, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D is drawn.<br />
<u>Step IV:</u> OA is joined and a circle is drawn with &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; diameter OA which intersected the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; previous circle at B and E.<br />
<u>Step V:</u> AE is joined.<br />
Thus, AB and AE are the required tangents to the circle from A.<br />

Justification:<br />
<br />
&#8736;OEA = 90&#176; (Angle in the semi circle)<br />

&#8756; OE &#8869; AE<br />
