        <br />
        <b>Answer</b><br />
        <br />
        Yes, tossing of a coin is a fair way of deciding which team should get the ball at the beginning of a football game because it has only two outcomes either head or tail. A coin is always unbiased.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="color: red;">4. Which of the following cannot be the probability of an event?</span><br />
        <span style="color: red;">(A) 2/3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) -1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C) 15% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (D) 0.7</span><br />
        <br />
        <b>Answer</b><br />
        <br />
        The probability of an event is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1.<br />
        Thus, (B) -1.5 cannot be the probability of an event.<br />

If it is equally likely that one of the coins will fall out when the bank is turned upside down, what is the probability that the coin (i) will be a 50 p coin ? (ii) will not be a &#8377;5 coin?</span><br />
        <br />
        <b>Answer</b><br />
        <br />
        No. of 50p coins = 100<br />
        No. of &#8377;1 coins = 50<br />
        No. of &#8377;2 coins = 20<br />
        No. of &#8377;5 coins = 10<br />
        Total no. of coins = 100 + 50 + 20 + 10 = 180<br />
        <br />
        (i) Favourable no. of elementary events = 100<br />
        Probability that it will be 50p coins = 100/180 = 5/9<br />

        <span style="color: red;">(ii) She will not buy it?</span><br />
        <br />
        <b>Answer</b><br />
        <br />
        Total numbers of pens = 144<br />
        Numbers of defective pens = 20<br />
        Numbers of non defective pens = 144 - 20 = 124<br />
        <br />
        (i) Numbers of favourable events = 124<br />
        Probability that she will buy it = 124/144 = 31/36<br />
        <br />
        (ii) Numbers of favourable events = 20<br />
        Probability that she will not buy it = 20/144 = 5/36<br />

        <span style="color: red;">&nbsp;23. A game consists of tossing a one rupee coin 3 times and noting its outcome each time. Hanif wins if all the tosses give the same result i.e., three heads or three tails, and loses otherwise. Calculate the probability that Hanif will lose the game.</span><br />
        <br />
        <b>Answer</b><br />
        <br />
        Events that can happen in tossing 3 coins = HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, HTT, THT, TTT<br />
        Total number of events = 8<br />
        Hinif will lose the game if he gets HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, HTT, THT<br />
        Favourable number of elementary events = 6<br />
        Probability of losing the game = 6/8 = 3/4<br />

        <span style="color: red;">(i) 5 will not come up either time? (ii) 5 will come up at least once?</span><br />
        <span style="color: red;">[Hint : Throwing a die twice and throwing two dice simultaneously are treated as the same experiment]</span><br />
        <br />
        <b>Answer</b><br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;(i) Consider the following events.<br />
        A = first throw shows 5,<br />
        B = second throw shows 5<br />
        P(A) = 6/36, P(B) = 6/36 and P(notB) = 5/6<br />
        &#8658; P(notA) = 1&#8211; 6/36 = 30/36 = 5/6<br />
        Required probability = 5/6 &#215; 5/6 = 25/36<br />
        <br />
        (ii) Number of events when 5 comes at least once = 11<br />
        Probability = 11/36<br />

        <span style="color: red;">25. Which of the following arguments are correct and which are not correct? Give reasons for your answer.</span><br />
        <span style="color: red;">(i) If two coins are tossed simultaneously there are three possible outcomes&#8212;two heads, two tails or one of each. Therefore, for each of these outcomes, the probability is 1/3</span><br />
        <span style="color: red;">(ii) If a die is thrown, there are two possible outcomes&#8212;an odd number or an even number. Therefore, the probability of getting an odd number is 1/2</span><br />
        <br />
        <b>Answer</b><br />
        <br />
        (i) The statement is incorrect<br />
        Possible events = (H,H); (H,T); (T,H) and (T,T)<br />
        Probability of getting two heads = 1/4<br />
        Probability of getting one of the each = 2/4 = 1/2<br />
        <br />
        (ii) Correct. The two outcomes considered are equally likely.<br />
